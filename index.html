    <!--Hidden explanation -->
    <p hidden>
        This shows the power of framing. We are more likely to choose something that is framed positively versus something that is framed negatively. The correct answer shows what the shampoo can do, which is a positive frame. The other response shows what the shampoo cannot do, which is a negative frame. However, the information is the same and the two shampoos are promising the same thing. The problem is that we are more likely to choose the positively-framed shampoo based on the way it's advertised, so we may lose out on other products. Alternatively, framing may help us find a good product.

        Again, the two advertising options have essentially the same information. However, we place more importance on avoiding losses, so we favor the option that only points out the gains. With medication, however, this could be really dangerous because people could choose a less effective brand of medication, depending on how it's framed.

        Both are selling the clothes for $20. However, we place value on products based on how high they're priced. So, a $30 item that is on sale for $10 seems like a better deal than a $20 item, even if the product it exactly the same. In the case of this eco-friendly clothing company, framing can be helpful in selling their products, which in turn can be beneficial to the environment.

        This has to do with relativity bias, where we compare our options to what is locally available. So, in our minds, 370 - 280 = $90 and 70 - 20 = $50, so the first option seems to be more profitable. When it comes to money, framing can cause losses because of biases like this.

        When action is required to change default settings, people are more likely to leave the default as is. So, if an organ donation is framed as an opt-out versus an opt-in, it's likely to be effective in creating more organ donors. It's an insidious framing trick, which can push people into becoming organ donors without too much thought.

        When we are threatened, we are less likely to be open to a product. However, when we are given an opportunity, we are more likely to be interested in a product. In this instance, framing can be helpful in promoting skincare. However, it can also be harmful because it may support a bad skincare company.
